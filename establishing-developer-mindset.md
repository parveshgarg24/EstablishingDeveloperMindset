## Letter to Self

Dear Deepanshu,

So you're having some trouble with your current projects? You knew it wasn't going to be easy. You will face many problems and at some point you will think to quit this. The Udacity people told you it wasn't going to be easy. Remember those articles you read at the beginning of the course? Okay, what to do...

First, get your mind right. Read some inspirational developer blogs. Subscribe to medium, use stackoverflow. What can you take away from this challenge so you can get better? Don't worry about how far along, or how much better, other developers are; they all had to go through this too.

Next, take a break! Watch some inspiring videos, or discuss the problem with your seniors and ask their approach on this. Seeing the problem with fresh eyes might do the trick.

Once you're back, here are some more suggestions:

Google & Stack Overflow - paste your errors into Google - the answer may pop right up, or at least give you some ideas on how to proceed.
Reach out for help. Ask developers at work for help, use forums in the course, try Slack too.
Keep going! Try to make a little progress each day.
"It ain't about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." - Rocky Balboa

Best, Deepanshu
